                I am a Senior Consultant currently working with mid-size startups to address platform scaling challenges. 
                Most of my experience is around building core backend infrastructure and cloud native services.
                Previously I partnered with my ex-manager to build a SaaS platform for project risk analysis where I was responsible for design and operations.
                My current interests are in applied AI especially around LLMs and RAG applications.<br/><br/> - I am an AI optimist
